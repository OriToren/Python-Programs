Python-Programs
Programs i write in python. with my very non elite knowledge il show how to use these libraries at their current state. i use these mostly for practice and to be able to maybe show later. Following these steps should allow you to use said libraries:
1)write this at the start of your python program:
  import sys
  sys.path.append(r"directory of MyPackage") #for example -> "C:\Users\אורי תורן\Pictures\Scripts\MyPackage"
  import (names of libaries) #for example quadraics
2)make sure that __init__.py is inside MyPackage
3)open with pycharm The directory Where MyPackage is  (in my example this would be scripts)  and mark MyPackage (with rightclick) and mark as Source Roots #this step isnt required but recommend

im hoping to keep making these in the future.
