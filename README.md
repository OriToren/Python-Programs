Python-Programs

Programs i write in python. with my very non elite knowledge il show how to use these libraries at their current state. i use these mostly for practice and to be able to maybe show later. Following these steps should allow you to use said libraries:

1)write this at the start of your python program:

&nbsp; import sys

&nbsp; sys.path.append(r"directory of MyPackage") #for example -> "C:\\Users\\אורי תורן\\Pictures\\Scripts\\MyPackage"

&nbsp; import (names of libaries) #for example quadraics

there exists a viable option if you dont want to type (name of libary).method() every time:

from (libaryname) import *
this makes sure that all methods are already deployed but makes it less readable
            
2)make sure that \_\_init\_\_.py is inside MyPackage

3)open with pycharm The directory Where MyPackage is  (in my example this would be scripts)  and mark MyPackage (with rightclick) and mark as Source Roots #this step isnt required but recommend



im hoping to keep making these in the future.
